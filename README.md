Sphere Schedule

About the Project

Sphere Schedule is a prototype Android mobile application focused on the design and user experience of modern scheduling systems.
The application combines core features found in popular meeting and appointment scheduling platforms into a single unified interface.

The project emphasizes UI/UX design, navigation flow, and usability rather than backend services, demonstrating how a real-world scheduling application would behave and interact with users.

Purpose

The objective of this project is to design and implement a clean, intuitive scheduling environment where users can:

- Plan daily tasks
- Book meetings
- Set appointments
- Manage reminders
- Organize time efficiently in one place

This project serves as a practical exploration of mobile interface architecture and user-centered design using Android native development tools.

Design Focus

This project mainly demonstrates:

- Mobile UI/UX structuring
- Layout hierarchy planning
- Screen-to-screen navigation flow
- User interaction design
- Consistent theming and component reuse

The prototype simulates a real scheduling product and can later be extended with:

- Firebase backend
- Notifications
- Authentication
- Cloud calendar sync
